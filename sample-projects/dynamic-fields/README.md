# React Dynamic Telephone Field

This project covers a practical example of a React component called `DynamicField`, which allows users to add and remove telephone number input fields dynamically. You will learn about state management, JavaScript array manipulation, and object handling while working on this project.

## Understanding the Code

To better understand the code, you should look at the following key concepts:

1. **State management**: React's `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the telephone numbers list in the component.
2. **JavaScript Array manipulation**: Functions like `map`, `filter`, and the spread operator are used to manage and manipulate the list of telephone numbers.
3. **Object handling**: The `handleInputChange` function updates the telephone numbers array by creating a new object with the updated value.

## Getting Started

To start working on this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork or clone the project repository from [https://github.com/kingsley-ijomah/React-State-Projects](https://github.com/kingsley-ijomah/React-State-Projects).

2. Install dependencies using `yarn`:

3. Start the development server using `yarn dev`:


## Next Steps

To demonstrate your understanding of the DynamicField component and practice what you've learned, try implementing the following features:

1. Add validation to ensure that only valid telephone numbers can be entered into the input fields.

Remember to consult the React documentation and resources related to JavaScript array and object manipulation if you need help along the way. Good luck!
