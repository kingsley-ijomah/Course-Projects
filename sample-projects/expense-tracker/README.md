# Expense Tracker

This React component is a simple Expense Tracker that allows you to manage a list of expenses, including their names and amounts. By studying and understanding this component, you'll learn about various topics such as state management, array and object manipulation in JavaScript, and more.

## Topics Covered
- React functional components
- useState hook for state management
- Array manipulation (map, reduce, and spread syntax)
- Object manipulation (creating new objects with updated properties)
- Form handling (e.preventDefault())

## Understanding the Code
To better understand the code, read through the comments in the `ExpenseTracker` component file. These comments break down the code into smaller parts and provide explanations for what each section does. Make sure to pay attention to how state is managed using the `useState` hook, and how the component is rendered using JSX syntax.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository from [https://github.com/kingsley-ijomah/React-State-Projects](https://github.com/kingsley-ijomah/React-State-Projects) or clone it.


2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using `yarn`:


3. Start the development server using `yarn dev`:


4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` or whatever your port number is to view the project.

## Next Steps
As a small assignment, try adding a feature that allows users to edit an existing expense item. This will help you demonstrate your understanding of the component's structure, state management, and event handling.
