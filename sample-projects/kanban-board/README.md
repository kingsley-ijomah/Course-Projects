# Kanban Board

This project is a simple implementation of a Kanban board using React. It covers various subjects including state management, the use of React DnD (Drag and Drop), and several JavaScript/Array/Object functions.

## What You Will Learn

1. State management using React hooks (useState, useEffect)
2. Implementation of drag and drop functionality using React DnD
3. JavaScript Array/Object manipulation such as `map`, `filter`, and more
4. Breaking down a complex UI into smaller, reusable components

## Understanding the Code

The project is divided into three main components:

1. `KanbanBoard`: This component manages the overall state of the application and includes the three Kanban columns.
2. `KanbanColumn`: This component represents a single Kanban column, and it accepts and displays Kanban items based on their status.
3. `KanbanItem`: This component represents a single task/item in the Kanban board, and it can be dragged and dropped between columns.

To better understand the code, start by reviewing the `KanbanBoard` component, as it contains the main application logic. Then, study the `KanbanColumn` and `KanbanItem` components to understand how they work together to create the board.
