# React Todo Component

This project is a simple Todo component built with React. It covers the following subjects:

- State management using React `useState` hook
- Basic JavaScript array manipulation
- Functional components and handling user input
- Styling components using Sass

## Understanding the Code

To better understand the code, pay attention to the following:

- The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the input field and the list of todos.
- The `handleClick` function is responsible for adding a new todo item to the list.
- The `handlechange` function updates the input field state as the user types.
- The component is styled using a separate Sass file, `Todo.module.scss`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, first clone or fork it from the following GitHub repository:

Then, follow these steps to install the dependencies and run the project:

1. Install the project dependencies using Yarn:

```


## Next Steps

As an assignment to demonstrate your understanding of the component, try implementing the following feature:

- Add a delete button to each todo item, which allows you to remove the item from the list.

Feel free to explore and add more features to improve the functionality of the Todo component.

## Motivation

> "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it."

This highlights the importance of hands-on experience when learning to code. As you work on this project and others, you'll develop a deeper understanding of programming concepts, languages, and libraries. Keep experimenting and building to gain confidence in your skills as a developer.
